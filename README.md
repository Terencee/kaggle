# kaggle

This repository contains my work in kaggle competitions. I am a regular kaggle competitor with in-depth knowledge in statistics. My focus is not to get the most perfect answer, as I realize the risks in overfitting. My focus is to refine my model building skills without over-fitting, to allow for models to be pushed in production.

Advanced_Regression.py contains ensemble regression techniques. It is the result of repeated trial and error.
